Repository Description: Airplane Simulation in python for ECE 5353, Spring 2024



version 1.6.2: implemented the altitude-gamma-alpha controller for delta e and aileron controller as well as beta and throttle control.


version 1.6.1: implemented the alpha controlled elevator with only one PID controller (alpha to delta_e) with p = -5, I = -0.0018 and D = -.5 


version 1.5: trim


version 1.4: implemented mav_dynamics_control.py as well as mavsim_chapter4.py. I stuck with the books outline as the other one i could not control correctly. also, controls are easier with those from what i noticed. 



version 1.3 : implemented mav_dynamics.py _f (refered to as derivatives() in the assignment file) function to include the derivatives.  Great work 10/10



version 1.2 : implented plane and B2 looking plane  Project 2 grade 10/10.  Super cool.  Hope you use the B2 visual from now on.
